# Tinker's Satchel Changelog

(🌧︎: Involves an accepted GitHub Pull Request or other significant assistance from the community. Thanks for your help!)

**5.2.0**

- Recompiled, remapped signatures, and updated dependencies for recent vanilla updates.
	- Fixed Pulse Monitor unintentionally consuming equipment charges.
- Fixed Old-War Lidar still working and applying damage even after the last item stack is lost.
- Spacetime Skein's attack and move speed bonuses can now be configured separately.
- Removed the Knockback Fin Float tweak module (vanilla item behavior was changed and the tweak behavior no longer really fits).
- Balance changes:
	- Prevented self-damage/debuff by default on the following items: Old-War Lidar, Macho Moustache, Negative Feedback Loop, Unstable Klein Bottle, Swordbreaker, Shrink Ray, Obsidian Brooch, Villainous Visage, Bramble Band.
		- Self-damage/debuff on these items is now configurable.
	- Major nerf to Old-War Lidar.
		- Attack frequency: 0.33/sec -> 0.25/sec.
		- Attack damage: 40% -> 20%.
		- Attack proc coefficient: 50% -> 35%.
		- *On closer inspection, this was kind of outperforming Ukelele, a similar Uncommon item.*
	- Moderate nerf to Spacetime Skein.
		- Attack speed bonus: +50% -> +30%.
		- Move speed bonus: +50% -> +40%.
- Balance-like item bugfixes:
	- Allowed Luck stat (57-Leaf Clover and Fudge Dice) to affect the following items: Wax Feather, Macho Moustache, Triskelion Brooch, Unstable Klein Bottle, Pinball Wizard, Obsidian Brooch.
		- Notably, this does not include Sturdy Mug nor Timelost Rum.
	- Sturdy Mug and Swordbreaker now use proper conic spread (was square).
	- Applied missing damage source information to all skills and Lodestone equipment.
		- Allows Luminous Shot to work on all 3 primary skills.
	- Excluded some buffs/debuffs from Growth Nectar and/or Noxious Thorn.
- Fixed a formatting issue in the Sturdy Mug description.
- Some backend improvements:
	- Suppressed a harmless (but very annoying) warning on a dependency.
	- Made BepInEx dependency version static.
	- Postbuild event can now create the Build folder and project name subfolder if missing (e.g. on a new clone of the repo).

**5.1.1**

- Fixed missing orig calls causing several vanilla items (Bustling Fungus, Warbanner, Mercurial Rachis, Effigy of Grief, Interstellar Deskplant, maybe others) to not function.

**5.1.0**

- Added inspect text to broken Item Drones and Bulwark Drones.
- Improved performance of Bulwark Drone, Celestial Gambit, EMP Device, Cardboard Box, and Lodestone by introducing component caching.
- Added the Knockback Fin Float module.
	- Reworks the SotS item Knockback Fin to use Unstable Klein Bottle's effect, minus the stun and plus some damage.
	- Now works on bosses and other unstunnable targets, inflicting damage only.
	- Slightly lowered proc chance by default.
- Separated Unstable Klein Bottle's effect into a new standalone debuff, Float.
	- Float holds a character in a fixed spot in the air for some time, then inflicts damage and flings the character downwards.
	- Additional stacks of Float cause previous ones to expire immediately, but the previous stack's timer is kept if it's still longer than the new duration.
	- Unstable Klein Bottle now inflicts stun as a separate effect.
	- Float, and by extension the Unstable Klein Bottle effect, can now be cleansed.
	- Significantly improved smoothness of midair hold animation.
- Pulse Monitor now triggers on-equipment-use items (e.g. Bottled Chaos, War Horn).
- Percussive Maintenance now counts equipment stashed in Scavenger's Rucksack for its unlock achievement.
- Removed an old debug log from a Quantum Recombobulator hook, which probably wasn't even showing up due to using Unity's logger.

**5.0.1**

- Small patch for incorrect language token argument count on Negative Feedback Loop description.

**5.0.0** *The Grinds My Gears Update*

- BREAKING:
	- Compat classes are now Internal. *Nobody should have been depending on these anyways, but major version increment it is.*
	- DelayedDamageBufferComponent was renamed and reworked to DelayedBarrierComponent.
- Fixes for Seekers of the Storm:
	- All achievements now have appropriate lunar coin rewards.
	- Causal Camera overlay now uses the new TemporaryOverlayManager system.
	- Fixed Scavenger's Rucksack activating equipment just before changing slots (activation is supposed to be suppressed while switching).
	- Fixed Pinball Wizard not working and causing errors on raycast bullet attacks.
	- Fixed Unstable Mortar Tube projectiles exploding immediately when fired, and then also on impact with anything.
	- Added EffectHelperComponent to projectile ghosts (fixes invisible projectiles).
	- Updated dependencies for new patch.
	- Retargeted changed hook signatures (fixes errors preventing mod load).
- Balance pass:
	- Unstable Mortar Tube projectiles now have 300 non-scaling health instead of 1 (to reduce the chances of them blowing up in your face immediately, at least early-game).
	- Stamina Bar now provides moderately more speed while grounded.
	- Reworked Negative Feedback Loop.
		- New behavior: grants barrier over time in response to damage taken, and having barrier multiplies effectiveness of regen stat based on barrier fraction.
		- Old behavior: converts some damage into a healable DoT.
		- *This item became redundant with a new item in SotS, Warped Echo.*
- Balance-like item bugfixes:
	- Percussive Maintenance can now crit-heal with Defibrillator.
	- Nautilus Protocol now works on Bulwark and Item Drones by default.
	- Silver Compass can no longer be activated during or after the Teleporter event.
	- Hurdy-Gurdy no longer works on Secondary skills with no cooldown.
	- Hurdy-Gurdy now works on specific configured skills, even if not Secondary (works with Railgunner's non-alternate Primary while scoped, by default).
- Removed a debug log that was inadvertently left in Kintsugi item count calculation.
- Migrated the PreventCurseWhileOff config from Artifact of Danger to its own tweak module, CurseKeepOSP.
- Fixed Hurdy-Gurdy using character forward (no vertical component) instead of aim forward.
- Fixed a hook subscription leak in Sturdy Mug (should have had minimal-to-no effect, unless repeatedly disabling and enabling the item in ingame config hundreds of times in one session).
- Project-wide code and comment cleanup.
	- Implemented some C#9 features made available by SotS.
	- Removed a bunch of TODO comments. *This is what we have GitHub issues and/or a separate private text file for.*
	- Removed some dead code and unnecessary using directives.
	- Suppressed some compiler messages.

**4.2.0** *The Swashbuckling Update*

- New content:
	- Items
		- Hurdy-Gurdy (T2): Wind up with uninterrupted Secondary skills to fire burning projectiles.
		- Swordbreaker (T2): Retaliate with exploding sparks when your shield is struck.
- Balance pass:
	- Bramble Ring: Partially reworked.
		- New effect: a small percentage of damage taken is converted to barrier. Taking barrier damage inflicts proportional bleed on the attacker.
		- Old effect: a percentage of damage taken was inflicted on the attacker.
		- *This item was too redundant with vanilla's Razorwire.*
	- Negative Feedback Loop:
		- Buffered damage is now nonlethal (can be disabled in config).
		- Buffered damage can now be cleansed by Blast Shower and other modded sources of DoT cleanse (can be disabled or made partial in config).
	- RC Controller:
		- Now grants a moderate amount of armor per stack per affected drone.
		- RC Controller now indefinitely toggles manual aiming with pings, instead of having a limited duration.
			- Removed the 'duwration' config option.
		- *This was a little too close to vanilla's Spare Drone Parts, and pretty much a worse version of it if you didn't have a use for the manual drone aiming.*
	- Reduced spawn chance of Bulwark Drone and Item Drone to match that of vanilla Equipment Drone.
- Removed Classic Items compatibility code.
	- *Classic Items has been deprecated for a while now. Recommended replacements include *Lost in Transit* and/or *Standalone Ancient Scepter*.*
	- Removed Beating Embryo functionality entirely. *Lost in Transit*'s Beating Embryo reduces cooldown instead of doubling effects.
	- Retargeted Ancient Scepter compatibility to work with Standalone Ancient Scepter.
- Renamed Bramble Ring to Bramble Band (for added alliterative appeal).
- Bramble Band retaliation damage is now visible as a void lightning orb.

**4.1.5**

- Fixed fatal errors caused by the base game Devotion Update.
- 🌧︎ Fixed Celestial Gambit preventing all teleporter drops if a player is dead when the teleporter boss dies.
- Fixed Bismuth Tonic applying the inverse of the expected buff duration change.
- Fixed Cardboard Box alternate icon path being incorrect, causing console log spam while an object is packed.
- Fixed very incorrect filters on Kintsugi item name checker (Kintsugi should now work at all and be unlockable under default settings).
- Made all strings used in Artifact of Safekeeping localizable.
	- This forced a removal of the AnnounceDropMode ItemTierCount setting, and a change in how item tiers display for pickups (color only, words removed).
- Made string used in Command Terminal revivals localizable.

**4.1.4**

- Fixed a potential NRE in Celestial Gambit causing the Teleporter to sometimes drop zero items.

**4.1.3**

	- Hydroponic Cell: Reworked.
		- New behavior: consumes 25% of healing, and provides a temporary buff for every 100% max health in consumed healing: +20% to all BASE stats (includes level bonuses) for 10 seconds.
		- Old behavior: consumes 50% of healing, and up to 10x max health in consumed healing is turned into a damage buff to heavy hits (400%+ base damage).
		- Now allows 25% of overheal to count as consumed healing (was 0%).
	- Chestplate: Reworked.
		- New behavior: provides a temporary armor buff based on gold income, with diminishing returns on gold amount only.
		- Old behavior: provides armor based on total gold held, with heavy diminishing returns on both item stacks and gold amount.
- Slightly clarified Ferrofluid melee attack description.
- Kintsugi now exposes a config for selecting which stats are affected.
- Fixed a duplicate effect prefab registration in Pinball Wizard.

**4.1.2**

- Balance pass:
	- Increased Item Drone range to 1000 m (was 100 m). Range is now configurable.
	- Item Drones no longer drop command droplets on death if Artifact of Command is enabled (configurable).
	- Huntress: MK7b Rockeye Mini:
		- Increased projectile stick radius to 0.4 m (was 0.25 m).
		- Increased base damage of both impacts to 150% (was 100%).
		- Increased blast radius to 8.5 m (was 7 m).
- Fixed some console spam caused by running server-only code on clients in Bulwark Drone, Sturdy Mug, Pinball Wizard, and Pulse Monitor.

- Visual tweaks to Huntress: MK7b Rockeye Mini:
	- Added a tracer effect.

	- Switched to a softer explosion effect.

**4.1.1**

- Balance pass:
	- Huntress: Mk7b Rockeye Mini (Primary):
		- Increased explosion proc coefficient from 0.5 to 1.
		- Increased explosion damage coefficient from 0.5 to 1 due to falloff.
		- Explosion now uses linear falloff (was erroneously using sweet-spot).
		- Increased explosion radius from 4 to 7.
		- Reduced base duration from 0.6s to 0.45s.
		- Increased projectile speed from 80 to 135.

**4.1.0** *The Skillful Update, Part Huntress*

	- Skills
		- Huntress: MK7b Rockeye Mini (Primary): Fire a non-seeking arrow which sticks and explodes, dealing damage and inflicting procs twice.
		- Huntress: Laser Bola (Secondary): Throw a seeking hard-light net which tethers groups of enemies for damage over time.
- Balance pass:
	- Celestial Gambit
		- Now adds ~1/6 the extra difficulty of a Shrine of the Mountain to the teleporter event per stack.
- Old-War Lidar now performs a team check before applying to a target, meaning self damage should no longer cause it to self-target.
- Lemurian's Claw and Celestial Gambit will no longer select AI-blacklisted items to give to enemies.
- Reorganized projectile prefab assets into their own folders (separate subfolder for ghosts).
- Fixed the Equipment Max Charges tweak not ever being applied. It may also now be enabled/disabled in config.
- Fixed a formatting error in the Macho Moustache description.
- Fixed a possible issue where void items may have depended on the vanilla SotV expansion, instead of the SotV+TS combo expansion.
- Fixed inverted normals on one side of the Stamina Bar model.
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.4.0 (required update).

**4.0.4** *The Other Drones Not Found Update*

**4.0.3**

- Ferrofluid no longer affects deployable projectiles, such as Engineer's mines.
- Fixed Sturdy Mug and Pinball Wizard custom projectiles not being added to networking catalog.
- Sturdy Mug now affects Huntress' primary attacks.
- Added proc coefficient configs to Lodestone, Faulty Mortar Tube, Sturdy Mug, En Passant, Unstable Klein Bottle, H3AD-53T, Pinball Wizard, Bramble Ring, Voidwisp Hive, and Nautilus Protocol.
- For performance reasons, Pixie Tube now stacks buff strength in one wisp, instead of count of individual wisps spawned. Previous behavior may be restored via config.
- Added missing corruption text to Villainous Visage description.
- Possibly fixed some errors causing Old-War Lidar to fire rapidly against dead enemies.

**4.0.2**

- Balance pass:
	- Ferrofluid
		- Aim magnetism angle now stacks logarithmically, starting at 1 degree and approaching halfway to 30 degrees after 50 stacks. (Previously: linear, 0.25 degrees per stack).
- Fixed Ferrofluid applying its melee push force backwards and for every frame of a melee attack, causing enemies to be flung into the stratosphere. Ferrofluid now applies a continuous vortex force while a melee hitbox is active, which is *meant* to be applied every frame.
- Fixed Ferrofluid melee effect unintentionally working on corpses.
- Fixed Ferrofluid melee effect unintentionally *not* working on Wisps.
- Fixed a missing chunk of description text for Commando: Pulse Grenade.

**4.0.1**

- Added the Moddable Equipment Slot Max Charges Patch, which allows easier change of maximum equipment charges per slot.
	- Fixes Stamina Bar applying triple max charges to ALL equipments while enabled.
- Added Sturdy Mug custom projectiles to some ranged skills which did not previously support the item.

**4.0.0**

- New content:
	- Items
		- Ferrofluid (T1): Your attacks become slightly magnetic and gain crit chance.
		- Concentrating Alembic (Lunar): Gain debuff strength and duration... BUT lose reach.
	- Equipments
		- Stamina Bar: Perform up to 3 dodge rolls.
- Balance pass:
	- Macho Moustache
		- Reworked. *Boring and completely non-situational global-damage-for-free item, meet woefully unexplored debuff mechanic!*
			- New behavior: Chance to Taunt enemies on hit. Receive less knockback and slightly less damage from Taunted enemies.
			- Old behavior: Deal more global damage based on number of enemies in combat.
	- Villainous Visage
		- Reworked.
			- New behavior: Brief stealth after killing Elites and Bosses; attacking breaks this stealth and adds a stacking damage bonus to the attack.
			- Old behavior: Brief damage bonus after entering combat, recharges out of combat.
	- Bismuth Tonic
		- Reworked.
			- New behavior: Reduce duration of both debuffs and buffs.
			- Old behavior: Take less damage from one of normal, elite, or boss enemies after being struck, but more from the other types.
	- Lemurian's Claw
		- Now reduces cost by 50% (configurable) instead of making purchases free.
	- *The following changes are intended to give some specialized items weak effects on otherwise incompatible builds.*
		- Extendo-Arms
			- Reduced damage bonus to 6.25% (was 7.5%).
			- Damage bonus now applies to all attacks (previously melee-only).
			- Now applies a 7.5% speed increase to projectile attacks per stack.
			- Now applies a 7.5% range increase to hitscan attacks per stack.
		- Sturdy Mug
			- Now adds a chance (equal to multishot chance) for melee swings to fire an inaccurate projectile for 25% relative damage.
		- Timelost Rum
			- Now adds a chance (equal to multishot chance) for melee hits to hit again after a delay for 25% relative damage.
		- Pinball Wizard
			- Now adds a chance (equal to projectile ricochet chance) for melee hits to fire a pinball projectile for 50% relative damage.
- Tinker's Satchel now exposes expansion entries in lobby UI, which control whether ALL mod content (except skills) appears per run.
- Cardboard Box, Quantum Recombobulator, and Lemurian's Claw now work on tier-2 category chests.
- Slightly improved the icons for Artifact of Reconfiguration.
- Backend: Some of the CommonCode file has been split into separate files.

**3.9.1**

- Fixed Scavenger's Rucksack (equipment slot swapping), RC Controller (ping AI override), and Nautilus Protocol (ping detonation) not working for clients in multiplayer.
- Fixed En Passant VFX not appearing for clients in multiplayer.
- Due to difficulty of netcode implementation, RC Controller and Nautilus Protocol are no longer able to suppress vanilla ping behavior.

**3.9.0**

- New content:
	- Items:
		- En Passant (T2): Melee strike with your Utility skill to recharge it.
		- Wax Feather (Lunar): Staying airborne ignites your attacks and lowers gravity... BUT also weakens your armor and speed.
		- Nautilus Protocol (T3 Void): All turrets and drones gain flat armor and regen, and a slight damage bonus. Ping to detonate. Corrupts all RC Controllers.
- Balance pass:
	- Lemurian's Claw:
		- Partial rework.
			- New behavior: targets a chest, which it will open for free and add an extra drop to. Will also grant enemies copies of an item from the same drop table, with count dependent on rarity (more common items grant more stacks).
			- Old behavior: targets an item, which it will duplicate one copy of to each ally, and one copy per ally to enemies.
			- *This item had too much cheese potential, between allowing saving it for "useless for enemies" items & being able to use it with an item discard mod. This change should make Lemurian's Claw harder to abuse, while also giving it some use in singleplayer.*
- Lemurian's Claw now displays an animation for granting items to enemies, instead of granting instantly and silently.
- Fixed Celestial Gambit being able to grant items to enemies after the teleporter boss dies.
- RC Controller now suppresses vanilla ping behavior while triggering an AI override (may be reverted in config).
- Potential fix for Scavenger's Rucksack slot swapping not working in multiplayer.
- Fixed missing Risk of Options integration on `Tinker's Satchel/Items.FudgeDice/BoostAmount`.

**3.8.0**

- Balance pass:
	- Celestial Gambit:
		- Partial rework.
			- No longer debuffs health nor prevents jumping.
			- Now gradually removes bonus items from the teleporter pool and gives them to enemies while the player carrying Celestial Gambit remains in midair. After 20 seconds of airtime (configurable), all bonus items will have been given to enemies.
			- The more stacks of Celestial Gambit an airborne player has, the faster bonus items will be given to enemies.
- Fixed Kintsugi not counting itself as a valid item.
- Fixed Kintsugi granting 1/100 of the intended armor and crit chance bonuses.
- Kintsugi now uses internal item names by default, but may also accept name tokens if prefixed with "@".

**3.7.0** *The Doozy of a Balance Pass Update*

- 1 Balance Pass, Doozy of a:
	- 🌧︎ Thank you for your feedback! Many of these changes were made after considering suggestions from the community.
	- Old-War Lidar:
		- Reworked.
			- Now fires a weak laser projectile (40% damage + 20% per stack) at acquired targets on reaching maximum charge. Charge resets after a projectile is fired.
			- Reduced charge time to 3 seconds (was 15 seconds).
			- No longer provides a damage buff.
	- Percussive Maintenance:
		- Now additionally scales with attack damage coefficient and maximum health.
			- New defaults: healing = 1% of maximum health * relative attack damage * attack proc coefficient * item stack count.
			- Old defaults: healing = 2 HP * attack proc coefficient * item stack count.
		- Increased self healing to 50% of ally healing (was 25%).
		- *Who's Leeching Seed? Never heard of 'em.*
	- Triskelion Brooch:
		- No longer stacks chance.
		- Now inflicts 80% slow instead of freeze.
		- Changed first-stack damage from 100% to 50%.
		- Changed per-extra-stack damage from 25% to 50%.
		- *This item was drastically overperforming for a tier-1, and also had something of a disparity in power between the different debuffs it could inflict.*
	- Defibrillator:
		- Removed the first-stack healing modifier. All stacks now add 25% to the healing value for critical heals (was 50% for first stack).
		- First stack now provides 5% crit chance (configurable), similarly to Predatory Instincts.
	- Negative Feedback Loop:
		- Changed damage absorption per stack to 10% (was 20%).
		- Changed absorbed damage delay to 3 sec (was 5 sec).
	- Pulse Monitor:
		- Changed low health threshold to 50% (was 25%).
			- Low health threshold is now configurable.
			- This does not affect the low health threshold for the item's unlock achievement, which remains hardcoded at 25%.
		- *Old War Stealthkit's 25% threshold was fine for triggering a guaranteed defensive buff, but using the same threshold here could be problematic with some equipment.*
	- Unstable Klein Bottle:
		- Reworked.
			- Now holds affected enemies stunned in midair for 1 second (duration and height configurable), instead of pushing/pulling based on nominal character playstyle.
		- Increased internal cooldown from 0.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds to remove the potential for complete stunlocks.
	- RC Controller:
		- Changed tier from Lunar to Rare/3.
		- Now only overrides an AI ally's aim for 30 seconds (configurable) after pinging it. Multiple AI may be overridden at once. All valid AI within range, overridden or not, will still receive the fire rate buff.
	- Spacetime Skein:
		- Buffs are no longer mutually exclusive. While one buff charges, the other buff will decay at 200% (configurable) of the charge speed.
		- Being hit will now force charging onto the movement buff for 0.25 seconds (configurable), instead of resetting the stationary buff.
		- Removed the grace period before registering a movement stop, as it is redundant with the above.
	- Scavenger's Rucksack:
		- Now intercepts equipment activation while the scoreboard is open and swaps slots then, instead of while standing still.
		- *I just fixed a bug here, and now I'm throwing away the fix and everything around it. Such is life!*
	- Bismuth Tonic:
		- Reduced increase to incoming damage from differing enemy tiers to 12.5% (was 25%).
	- Silver Compass:
		- Now applies a second stack of Challenge of the Mountain, but only one extra item (behavior was already present, but off by default).
	- Lens of Order:
		- Reduced base armor bonus to 100 (was 500).
		- Reduced downscaling per other item to 2.5% (was 12.5%).
		- Now scales linearly instead of exponentially with further stacks.
		- *The variation of usefulness of this item between early and late game was a little too spiky.*
	- Villainous Visage:
		- No longer triggers when entering danger (taking damage), only when entering combat (dealing damage or using a combat skill).
		- *My evil plan starts when I SAY it does, and no sooner, thank you very much.*
- Fixed an issue where Item Drone was not respecting the FakeInventory item blacklist under some circumstances. Resolves a bug with Standalone Ancient Scepter et al.
- Implemented a slightly cleaner solution to keeping Timelost Rum projectile tracer effects in worldspace (also used in Old War Lidar rework).
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.3.4.

**3.6.0**

- Balance pass:
	- Fudge Dice now provides 9 luck (configurable) on affected rolls, instead of guaranteeing a success. This is intended to prevent an inordinate effect this item was having on very-low-chance events, such as Aspect equipment drops.
	- Kintsugi now counts itself as a broken/consumed item by default (so it will never have zero effect).
	- Gup Ray now also debuffs its targets' move and attack speed by 50% per split (configurable, exponential).
- Restored missing chunks of the Taunt effect description.
- 🌧︎ Fixed a typo that was preventing the Scavenger's Rucksack movement grace period from working.
- Fixed Timelost Rum proc chance displaying in its description as 1/100 of the actual value.
- Updated R2API dependency to 5.0.6 (now using split assembly).
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.3.3.
- Updated BepInExPack dependency to 5.4.2103.

**3.5.0**

- Item Drones now support holding more than 1 item type.
	- `public ItemIndex ItemDrone.ItemDroneWardPersist.index` is now obsolete and will have no effect.
	- `public int ItemDrone.ItemDroneWardPersist.count` is now obsolete and will have no effect.
	- Added `public int[] ItemDrone.ItemDroneWardPersist stacks {get; private set;}` (populated via `ItemCatalog.RequestItemStackArray()`).
	- Added `public void ItemDrone.ItemDroneWardPersist.AddItems(ItemIndex ind, int count)`.
- Added Spare Drone Parts IDRs to Item Drone and Bulwark Drone.
- Item Drone now supports the Dronemeld mod (requires Dronemeld 1.3.0 or later).
- Fixed bad armature/animation setup (extraneous 90-degree rotations) on Item Drone.
- Renamed Armor Crystal to Chestplate and gave it a new model and lore.
- Renamed Armor Prism to Lens of Order and improved its model.
- Character models are now set to read/write enabled (stops some rare console spam).
- For developers: NuGet config is now localized (building project no longer requires end-user modification of system or directory NuGet config).
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.3.2.

**3.4.1**

- Migrated a few language tokens missed in the first pass (skills, CommonCode). <small>Slippery little devils...</small>

**3.4.0** *The Translatable Update*

- Migrated ALL language tokens to a language file, making the mod more translation-friendly (read: it can now be done at all).
- Fixed Fudge Dice being nonfunctional and causing per-frame errors once obtained.
- Unstable Klein Bottle velocity, range, and internal cooldown are now configurable (defaults unchanged at 30 m/s, 20 m, 0.5 s).
- Shrink Ray damage debuff and visual scale amounts are now configurable (defaults unchanged at 50% and 50%).
- Made some improvements to item descriptions.
- Added lore to some items.
- Fixed some cases of erroneous spaces before percentage signs in item descriptions.
- Minor project cleanup.
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.3.1.
	- Necessary for language system changes.

**3.3.2**

- Fixed Scavenger's Rucksack breaking Heretic transformation, luck calc, and Goobo Jr setup.

**3.3.1**

- Fixed Lemurian's Claw breaking other targetable equipments.
- Balance pass:
	- Quantum Recombobulator now provides an option, enabled by default, to retain category of recombobulated interactables (e.g. cannot turn a chest into a shrine, or a printer into a non-printer).
- Slightly improved Quantum Recombobulator per-frame search performance.
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 7.2.1.
	- Fixes Item Drone name modification showing item type only appearing for the host in multiplayer.
	- Fixes a mostly harmless NRE after using Quantum Recombobulator.

**3.3.0**

- New content:
	- Items:
		- Fudge Dice (T2): Every 20 seconds, automatically succeed on a random roll.
		- Celestial Gambit (Lunar): Gain an extra item from the teleporter... BUT the teleporter zone weakens you (50% reduced healing per stack, no jumping). <small>Strawb!!</small>
		- Lemurian's Claw (Lunar Equipment): Give a target item drop to ALL characters. Enemies receive multiple, 1 per ally.
		- Scavenger's Rucksack (Boss): Hold one extra equipment. Stand still to cycle through equipment slots. Rarely replaces Scavenger backpack drops.
	- Artifacts:
		- Artifact of Reconfiguration: Start with 2 Scavenger's Rucksacks. All equipment has no cooldown and is consumed on use. Spawns a lot of extra equipment every stage.
- Balance pass:
	- Bulwark Drone:
		- Bulwark Drone was severely overperforming in an attempt to justify its high cost and lack of attacks, especially when multiple were obtained. Its taunt mechanic was also unintentionally inconsistent.
		- Now spawns with one stack of Razorwire. <small>Those shields are pointy!</small>
		- Reduced taunt chance per enemy (50% --> 25%).
		- Now selects a consistent fraction of valid targets to taunt, instead of rolling a chance for each target.
		- Reduced base stats (health 400 --> 275, shield 60 --> 25, health regen 5 --> 2, armor 20 --> 0, move speed 20 --> 15).
		- Increased hitbox size.
		- Reduced base cost ($80 --> $60).
	- Item Drone can no longer accept Lunar nor Void items by default. <small>You are now <i>slightly</i> safer from your friends.</small>
- Item Drone item blacklist is now configurable and also includes a tier blacklist.
- Made Bulwark Drone compatible with the Dronemeld mod.
- Kintsugi:
	- Fixed double percentage signs in description.
	- Fixed missing unlockable icon.

**3.2.0**

- Balance pass:
	- Minor rework to Mostly-Tame Mimic. MTM was always meant to provide unpredictable power boosts, but the execution was unclear and the item's moment-to-moment effects were sometimes hard to notice. The following changes are meant to focus on this role more strongly; providing a much spikier item distribution with more clearly defined points of change over time, as well as giving the player more time to identify and take advantage of boosted items:
		- Now scrambles all-at-once instead of gradually over time (15% --> 100% chance per mimic), using a much longer interval (3s --> 15s). Renamed the DecayRate config option to ScrambleRate, and removed the DecayChance config option.
		- Now only selects a small fraction of all available items per tier (100% --> 20% of item types per tier, rounded up). Added the ChanceTableSpikiness config option to support this feature.
		- No longer redistributes mimics as soon as the last stack of a mimicked item is lost, in order to avoid abuse of by-tier selection alongside e.g. a conveniently-placed scrapper/printer or an item drop mod. Will instead remove those mimics and wait for the next scramble.
		- Removed the obsolete LagLimit config option.
	- Bismuth Tonic now applies to entire tiers of enemy (Normal, Elite, or Boss) instead of individual enemy types.

- Added the Equipment Drone Labels tweak module, which applies the Item Drone naming scheme to vanilla Equipment Drones.
- Slightly clarified Shrink Ray's pickup text.
- Fixed Spacetime Skein buffs erroneously appearing until the next stage after all stacks are lost.
- Updated BepInExPack dependency to 5.4.1905.

- Fixed an accidental hard dependency on Risk of Options in the 3.1.0 presets feature.

**3.1.0**

- Skills may now be enabled/disabled while the game is running.
- Fixed a rare error during language reloads.
- Added an unlock achievement to Armor Crystal.

- General project cleanup.
	- Addressed or suppressed almost all compiler warnings/messages.

	- H3AD-53T now counts as a melee attack for purposes of Extendo-Arms.
	- Causal Camera now has a configurable minimum time (default 3s), to make Gesture stacking while you have one less existentially hazardous.
- Command Terminal will no longer summon Item Drone or Bulwark Drone if they are disabled.
- If Command Terminal is allowed to work with Bottled Chaos in config (disabled by default), it will no longer remove other equipments when triggered by Bottled Chaos.
- Timelost Rum now properly spawns projectiles at a muzzle point, instead of at the owner's core position (could lead to self-collision if stationary).

	- Adding the first 3 of these to the readme early was totally an intentional teaser and *not* a Git mishap at all I swear <_< >_>

**2.2.3**

		- Cardboard Box "in use" alternate icon has not yet been updated.

	- Affected equipments: Lodestone, Cardboard Box, Quantum Recombobulator, Command Terminal, Causal Camera.
	- Affected skills: Commando: Plasma Grenade.

**2.0.0** *The I Finally Got My Hands on the DLC for Testing Update, Part 1*

- ADDED ITEMS: Voidwisp Hive, Bramble Ring, Gup Ray!
- BREAKING CHANGES:
	- Villainous Visage internal code name has changed (VoidMoustache --> EnterCombatDamage).
		- Component name has also changed (VoidMoustacheDamageTracker --> EnterCombatDamageTracker).
	- Armor Prism internal code name has changed (VoidGoldenGear --> OrderedArmor).
		- Component name has also changed (VoidGoldenGearComponent --> OrderedArmorComponent).
	- These changes make these items much easier to address with TILER2 NetConfig commands and breaks this pattern for future items. Previously, full name e.g. 'Items.Moustache' would have to be used to resolve ambiguity with the void variant name.
- Go-Faster Stripes now gives a +50% speed buff for 3 seconds when an unhandled utility skill is used.
	- Other mods can indicate that they have handling for a utility skill set up by adding their SkillDefs to `GoFaster.instance.handledSkillDefs`.
- All Void items now have the expansion icon overlay on their item icons.
- All Void items now have required expansion correctly specified and should no longer appear in logbook while unavailable.

**1.14.1**
- Balance pass.
	- Commando: Jink Jet:
		- Allowed slightly more vertical component to jump trajectory (0.125 --> 0.15).
		- Increased forced vertical component used while grounded (0.25 --> 0.3).
	- Commando: Plasma Grenade:
		- Buffed cooldown to match Frag Grenade (8s --> 6s).
		- Homing now has a brief arming delay (0.5s) to prevent nearby enemies from intercepting throws. Direct impacts will still stick.
	- Macho Moustache:
		- Nerfed default elite stacking bonus from +2 to +1.
		- Nerfed default champion stacking bonus from +4 to +2.
		- This item was performing too well in lategame; the unlock achievement was also far easier to trigger than intended.
- Fixed Quantum Recombobulator not checking its valid object name list while selecting an object to recombobulate into.
	- The barrels have been banished for good this time. Definitely.
	- In an extreme edge case (no spawncards available at all), this could also have led to a vanishing object or an exception. Equipment should now fail to activate, as intended, in this case.
- Fixed Commando: Plasma Grenade potentially slowing to a crawl during homing.
- Slightly improved Commando: Plasma Grenade VFX/SFX:
	- Fuse ray effects are slightly thinner and no longer disconnected from the model.
	- Made sound effect tempo slower to make it more distinct from Sticky Bomb.
- Sturdy Mug can no longer cause multiple Goobos Jr. to spawn per equipment cast.
- Quantum Recombobulator no longer adds the Cardboard Box player data storage component on equip (had no player-facing effect other than an infinitesimal amount of performance loss).

- Fixed Taunt keyword token not resolving.
- General behind-the-scenes cleanup and Visual Studio Intellisense message resolution.

**1.13.2**

- Balance pass.
	- Shrink Ray no longer procs on self damage.
		- This was unintentional, but can be considered a balance change as some base game items proc on self damage.
	- Partially reworked Hydroponic Cell's mechanics to be simpler.
		- While it provided some flavor, the 'nutrients' buff stage gained by taking damage was redundant, and provided a balance lever that was also redundant. This has been removed and reduced to the core purpose of requiring you to heal health (i.e. NOT overheal, barrier, etc.) to gain the item's benefit. Flavor has been relocated to the pickup text.
- Improved descriptions of Hydroponic Cell, Engineer: Smart Flak, and Engineer: Decoy Chaff.
- Clarified Macho Moustache config descriptions.
- Fixed skills appearing in the loadout menu while disabled.
- Command Terminal now exposes its list of summonable drones to config.
- Added extra null safety to Sturdy Mug.
	- Specifically, affected projectiles should no longer cause further errors if something causes the networked prefab list to desync in multiplayer.

	- RC Controller: buffed default attack speed bonus (25% &rarr; 40%).
	- Engineer: Speed Dispenser:

- Engineer: Chaff: Renamed to Decoy Chaff for clarity.
- Engineer: Speed Dispenser fixes:
	- Fixed not being set to player team.
	- Now has its own deployable slot so mods that tweak the max shield count won't affect it.

**1.13.0** *The Skillful Update, Part Engineer*

- ADDED SKILL VARIANTS:
	- Engineer: Smart Flak, Chaff, Speed Dispenser!
- Bulwark Drone now uses the same Taunt debuff added by Chaff (will now apply a damage debuff vs non-Taunters and allow attacking any Taunter).
- Updated an older language token name format on Silver Compass (all instances of "TINKSATCH" --> "TKSAT").
- Fixed Percussive Maintenance not working if used by multiplayer clients.
- Fixed some Mostly-Tame Mimic NREs during object creation/destruction.

**1.12.3**

- Fixed Unstable Klein Bottle pull-mode force being *much* higher than intended.
- Fixed missing style tags in Unstable Klein Bottle description.

**1.12.2**

- Balance pass.
	- Macho Moustache:
		- Now has a radius of 100 m (was 10 m).
		- Now provides a damage bonus of 1% per enemy per stack (was 5%).
		- Now only works on enemies in combat (used a skill recently) or danger (was hurt recently).
		- Now counts elites and champions/bosses as multiple enemies (default +2/+4).
		- Renamed existing config options to force changes, as this is effectively a major rework to further differentiate the item from Focus Crystal.
	- Negative Feedback Loop:
		- No longer triggers on-hurt items.
		- No longer applies to fall damage.
		- Now procs its DoT once per frame (effectively continuously) by default. This config was not forced to update; default 0.2s will still be in place for already-installed copies of the mod.
	- Percussive Maintenance:
		- Now also heals you when you heal an ally (for 25% the amount by default).
	- Unstable Klein Bottle:
		- Now pulls enemies instead of pushing if procced by a melee survivor. List of melee survivors is configurable (by body name).
	- RC Controller:
		- Nerfed first-stack fire rate to match per-extra-stack rate (100% --> 25%).
	- Quantum Recombobulator:
		- By default, can no longer work on, nor turn objects into, money barrels or Rusty Key boxes (latter did not work anyways).
- Percussive Maintenance now passes through proc chain masks instead of using an empty one.
- Phrasing tweak on Defibrillator description.
- Fixed Pinball Wizard unintentionally affecting deployables and Rex's Special skill. Now has a configurable projectile name blacklist.

**1.12.1**

- Balance pass.
	- Hydroponic Cell now adds base damage instead of direct damage.
	- Hydroponic Cell now has a minimum hit threshold similar to the elemental bands (defaults to the same amount, 400%).
	- Unstable Klein Bottle now deals damage (50% by default).
	- Allowed Pixie Tube to work on some previously-blacklisted skills (MUL-T and Railgunner mode switches) now that an ICD is in place.
	- Reduced Bulwark Drone shield (100 --> 60) and armor (50 --> 20). Testing found it to be both too evasive and too tanky at once.
- Hydroponic Cell informational buffs are now percentages of max charge (was previously integer times max health / damage stat).
- Hydroponic Cell is now implemented as a separate instance of damage due to technical limitations on the minimum hit threshold.
- Improved AI on Item Drone and Equipment Drone. Slightly. They're still drones.
- Item Drone and Equipment Drone now use continuous collision detection (much lower chance of flying through walls).

**1.12.0** *The Science! Update, Part 3*

- ADDED INTERACTABLES: Bulwark Drone!
- ADDED ITEMS: Faulty Mortar Tube, Hydroponic Cell, EMP Device, Shrink Ray!

	- Item Drone no longer accepts AI summon items like Queen's Gland, nor consumable/consumed items.
	- Mostly-Tame Mimic no longer mimics consumable items.

- Item Drone:
	- Now has a custom model and cleaner setup code (thanks ThunderKit!).
	- Improved spawncard compatibility (now properly registered/deregistered instead of setting spawn weight to 0).

- Added a config to disable self-proc on Triskellion Brooch (self-proc is allowed by default).
- Fixed Quantum Recombobulator being usable twice on the same object if it recombobulates into a multishop.
- Artifact of Safekeeping:
	- Added a config option controlling what to display in chat when an item is taken (specific item name, item tier only, vague "something was taken", or nothing).
	- Now has a configurable announcement for items dropped when the boss dies (item tier counts, total item count, or nothing).

	- Go-Faster Stripes blast-jumping on Engineer and Bandit now resets vertical velocity.
	- RC Controller now causes Equipment Drones to activate equipment.
	- Pixie Tube may now proc on primary skill once every 5 seconds (allows effects on characters with only a primary skill, e.g. some monsters).
- Artifact of Safekeeping:
	- Now displays a chat message for each item taken by the teleporter boss.
	- Vastly improved item drop trajectories (notably: much smaller chance to send items off cliffs).
		- Item droplets will now try to find clear trajectories towards open navigation graph nodes.
		- If not enough clear paths exist around the boss, will try scanning from the teleporter instead.
		- If both methods fail to find any nodes, items will launch in a fixed circle around the teleporter.
	- Hooks made more compatible with other mods.
- Fixed missing TILER2 AutoConfigUpdateActions on many items (changing some configs mid-game would not immediately update language and/or character stats).
- Updated R2API dependency to 4.3.5.
- Updated TILER2 dependency to 6.2.0.

**1.10.2**

- Fixed any and all game VFX going missing at random (caused by Pinball Wizard effect prefab waking up during game load).

- Negative Feedback Loop no longer spams red vignette and flinch animation (added Silent damage type).
- Cardboard Box:
	- Now returns packed objects to their original locations when unequipped.
	- Can now move Warbanners.
- Fixed Bismuth Tonic cooldown only applying to subsequent hits taken after the first.
- Sturdy Mug no longer works on *any* Deployables (was case-by-case blacklist before). Fixes poor interaction with Railgunner utility and future-proofs for similar skills.
- Pinball Wizard:
	- Fixed causing sticky projectiles to not explode (e.g. Sticky Bomb, Railgunner specials) -- no longer procs on these.
	- Now ignores the Neutral team (e.g. flying rocks hazard on Sky Meadows).

**1.9.4**

- Balance pass.

	- No longer rewinds Captain's once-per-stage beacon skills.
- Pixie Tube:
	- Prevented from working with Railgunner's secondary.
	- Reduced wisp arming time (2s --> 1.5s).

	- Wisps on player team now wait until near the end of their lifetime (2s left) to gravitate towards non-player allies.
- Pinball Wizard: stole some vanilla SFX for the proc effect. Only works on physical projectiles for now, and not hitscan attacks.

**1.9.3**

- Causal Camera no longer restores drop pod/teleport immunity.

**1.9.2**

- Balance pass.
	- Bismuth Flask:
		- Now has an effect duration (10s by default) instead of lasting forever.
		- This item is meant to reward skillful kiting, not punish you for fighting more than one enemy type ever.

		- I greatly underestimated how powerful auto-aim bounces on missed attacks could be >_>
		- Now affected by luck, but has a lower default proc chance (35% --> 15%).
		- No longer stacks damage per bounce.

	- Mostly-Tame Mimic:
		- No longer mimics useless items (scrap/consumed).
	- Percussive Maintenance:
		- Now scales based on proc coefficient (matches Leeching Seed behavior).

- Bismuth Tonic: Fixed a serious NRE related to Engineer turrets.
- Fixed Cardboard Box not syncing for clients on non-dedicated servers.
- Triskelion Brooch:
	- Fixed proc chance not being checked and always proccing in some cases.

- Pixie Tube:
	- Wisps now increase the range at which they gravitate towards allies over time (6 m --> 36 m).

- Fixed the AI blacklist setting on Pulse Monitor not having a config option.

**1.7.2**

		- No longer causes NREs if one of its pending targets gets killed before a proc happens, because targets will no longer pend.
